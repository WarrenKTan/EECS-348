1. Is there a fault in the program? If so, locate it and explain
There is a fault in the indexing of the 'for' loop.
for (int i = 1; i < attendance_records.size(); ++i)
Indexing starts at '1', resulting in an unread value at index '0'.

2. Define a test case that does not execute the fault:
It is imposible to avoid execution of the fault since the fault
occurs inside a loop that always executes given any valid input.

3. Define a test case that executes the fault but does not result in an error state:
expected output: True
actual output: True

4. Define a test case that results in an error state but not a failure.
expected output: False
actual output: False

5. Define a test case that results in failure.
expected output: True
actual output: False
